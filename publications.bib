	abstract = "We propose a new framework, inspired by random matrix theory, for analyzing the dynamics of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) when both number of samples and dimensions are large. This framework applies to any fixed stepsize and the finite sum setting. Using this new framework, we show that the dynamics of SGD on a least squares problem with random data become deterministic in the large sample and dimensional limit. Furthermore, the limiting dynamics are governed by a Volterra integral equation. This model predicts that SGD undergoes a phase transition at an explicitly given critical stepsize that ultimately affects its convergence rate, which we also verify experimentally. Finally, when input data is isotropic, we provide explicit expressions for the dynamics and average-case convergence rates, i.e. the complexity of an algorithm averaged over all possible inputs. These rates show significant improvement over the worst-case complexities.",

When $\beta > 4$ we obtain a new class of limiting distributions that arise when both $n$ and $N$ tend to infinity simultaneously. We solve an open problem of Diaconis and Gamburd by showing that for $\beta=2$, the middle coefficient of degree $n=\lfloor\frac{N}{2}\rfloor$ tends to zero as $N \to \infty$. We show how the theory of Gaussian multiplicative chaos (GMC) plays a prominent role in these problems and in the explicit description of the obtained limiting distributions. We extend the remarkable \textit{magic square formula} of Diaconis and Gamburd for the moments of secular coefficients to all $\beta>0$ and analyse the asymptotic behaviour of the moments. We obtain estimates on the order of magnitude of the secular coefficients for all $\beta > 0,$ and these estimates are sharp when $\beta \geq 2$.  These insights motivated us to introduce a new stochastic object associated with the secular coefficients, which we call {Holomorphic Multiplicative Chaos (HMC)}. Viewing the HMC as a random distribution, we prove a sharp result about its regularity in an appropriate Sobolev space. Our proofs expose and exploit several novel connections with other areas, including random permutations, Tauberian theorems and combinatorics.",

Compared to worst-case analysis, it is more representative of the typical behavior of an algorithm, but remains largely unexplored in optimization. One difficulty is that the analysis can depend on the probability distribution of the inputs to the model. However, we show that this is not the case for a class of large-scale problems trained with first-order methods including random least squares and one-hidden layer neural networks with random weights. In fact, the halting time exhibits a universality property: it is independent of the probability distribution. With this barrier for average-case analysis removed, we provide the first explicit average-case convergence rates showing a tighter complexity not captured by traditional worst-case analysis. Finally, numerical simulations suggest this universality property holds for a more general class of algorithms and problems.",

	abstract="In this paper, we consider tridiagonal matrices the eigenvalues of which evolve according to $\beta$-Dyson Brownian motion.  This is the stochastic gradient flow on $\mathbb{R}^n$ given by, for all $1 \leq i \leq n,$
	\[
	d\lambda_{i,t} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{\beta}}dZ_{i,t} - \biggl( \frac{V'(\lambda_i)}{2} - \sum_{j: j \neq i} \frac{1}{\lambda_i - \lambda_j} \biggr)\,dt
	\]
	where $V$ is a constraining potential and $\left\{ Z_{i,t} \right\}_1^n$ are independent standard Brownian motions.  This flow is stationary with respect to the distribution
	\[
	\rho^{\beta}_N(\lambda) = \frac{1}{Z^{\beta}_N} e^{-\frac{\beta}{2}
	\left( -\sum_{1 \leq i \neq j \leq N} \log|\lambda_i - \lambda_j| + \sum_{i=1}^N V(\lambda_i) \right)
	}.
	\]
	The particular choice of $V(t)=2t^2$ leads to an eigenvalue distribution constrained to lie roughly in $(-\sqrt{n},\sqrt{n}).$  We study evolution of the entries of one choice of tridiagonal flow for this $V$ in the $n\to \infty$ limit. On the way to describing the evolution of the tridiagonal matrices we give the derivative of the Lanczos tridiagonalization algorithm under perturbation. ",

		Distributional lattices exist in any Riemannian symmetric space:
		the Voronoi tessellation of a stationary Poisson point process

		amenability, the amenability of a distributional lattice is
		equivalent to the amenability of the ambient space. Using this

		Voronoi tessellation has positive graph speed by developing some

	abstract = "The von Koch curve, as Helge von Koch himself observes, can be quite naturally generalized. One such family of generalizations can be built using n-gons. To build these curves, fix some positive scalar c less than one. Draw a line segment with unit length. Replace the middle c portion of the segment with the sides of a regular n-gon whose own sides are length c. This produces a total of n+1 line segments. Recursively apply this procedure to each line segment, and take the limit to produce the (n,c)-von Koch Curve. For fixed n and c sufficiently large, the curve intersects itself. Likewise, for c sufficiently small, the curve does not. The trouble with the (n,c)-von Koch curve is what happens in between. The set of c for which the curve self-intersects is not necessarily an interval, a phenomenon that we explore here.",

		orbifolds with boundary. The theorem relates the index sum of a
		smooth vector field in generic contact with the boundary
		orbifold to the Euler-Satake characteristic of the orbifold and
		a boundary term. The boundary term is expressed as a sum of
		Euler characteristics of tangency and exit-region orbifolds. As
		a corollary, we express the index sum of the vector field
		induced on the inertia orbifold to the Euler characteristics of
		the associated underlying topological spaces.
